# Expense-Tracker-Collab-Project
Instructions: 
Use mouse cursor to navigate through user interface. Follow on-screen prompts to use expense tracker.

Responsibilities & Credits:
  Alex Lu: Made UI, debugging, removing, editing, and overall helped Kevin & Jason with code.
    
  Kevin Poon: Did adding, catagorization/filtering, and calculations.

  Jason Qu: Did viewing, testing, debugging, and suggestions/comments.

Reflection: 
In this project, Alex Lu, Kevin Poon, and Jason Qu, collaborated to create an expense tracker program-capable of calculating, filtering, removing, adding, and viewing expenses, with the added bonus of an impressive user interface within the code itself. For task delegation, Alex created the UI, did overall editing, as well as the remove function and some debugging. Kevin completed the adding, filtering, and calculating functions. Jason tested the program, did overall debugging, as well as viewing of the code, and any subsequent suggestions and comments for improvement. Now, of course things didn't proceed completely smoothly, there were several problems we encountered in making our code. Firstly, despite such a skilled cast of programmers, we ran into the issue of incompatible codes. Since we were working on separate branches, often at different times, our codes ended up diverging in certain portions-creating the issue of incompatible codes. To address this, we worked together during classtime to fix and put together code, ensuring that the program would run smoothly. Another problem we encountered was the complexity of code, albeit not necessarily an issue with the code itself, but a problem nonetheless. The use of advanced and previously unseen programming language (by Alex) was particularly challenging for Kevin and Jason to adapt and work with, but through Alex's guidance and education, we managed to not only work with, but build upon this complicated program. Otherwise, no notable problems aside from the occasional syntax error were present. As for whether we enjoyed collaborative coding or not, the answer is a resounding yes. This project has allowed us all to learn from, and teach eachother with our unique skillsets and knowledge bases. It was fun, and a joy to complete
